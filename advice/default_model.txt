## Protective Role - Mild Unnatural Tendencies

- Your protective role is naturally a Guardian and your environment lets you be who you want to be known for most of the time.  A guardian protects, confronts threats, and defends his loved ones. Your surrounding allows you to be who you are majority of the time. However, there are times when you feel like you can't be a Guardian and may feel weak in your ability to protect others or fight off threatening scenarios.
